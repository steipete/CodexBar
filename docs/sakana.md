# Sakana AI

[Sakana AI](https://sakana.ai) is a research lab focusing on foundation models and nature-inspired AI. CodexBar reads
the billing page to surface 5-hour and weekly quota windows for subscribers.

## Setup

1. Sign in at [console.sakana.ai](https://console.sakana.ai).
2. Open your browser's developer tools, navigate to the **Network** tab, and reload the billing page
   (`console.sakana.ai/billing`).
3. Copy the full `Cookie:` request header value from any billing-page request.
4. In CodexBar, paste the header in **Settings → Providers → Sakana AI → Cookie header**.
   The value is stored unencrypted in the [resolved config file](configuration.md#location). CodexBar sets that file's
   permissions to `0600` whenever it writes the file on macOS or Linux.

Alternatively, set the environment variable `SAKANA_COOKIE` to the raw cookie header value.

## Data source

- **Auth method**: manual `Cookie:` header; no automatic browser cookie import.
- **Target page**: `https://console.sakana.ai/billing` (HTML scrape; no JSON API).
- **Source label**: `web`.

## Usage details

- The primary row shows the **5-hour quota** as a 300-minute session window and uses the reset timestamp shown on the
  billing page when one is present.
- The secondary row shows the **weekly quota** as a seven-day window and uses its billing-page reset timestamp when
  one is present.
- `usedPercent` for each window is parsed from the billing page's adjacent `% used` text.
- Reset dates are parsed from the billing page using the device's local time zone (`TimeZone.current`).
  The fetcher detects `"MMMM d, yyyy 'at' h:mm a"` format strings.
- Plan name and price label (e.g. `Standard $20/mo`) are joined and surfaced as the `loginMethod` identity field for
  plan display in the menu.
- Token cost tracking (`supportsTokenCost: false`): not supported; cost summary is unavailable. Sakana has no
  organization-level usage/cost API to query historically, only the per-request `usage` object returned by chat
  completions calls (which CodexBar never makes), so there is no local-log source to scan the way Claude/Codex are.
- Credits row (`supportsCredits: true`): shows the Pay-as-you-go credit balance (see below).
- Widget support: not currently available for Sakana AI.

## Pay-as-you-go credits

Sakana also sells prepaid credit for pay-as-you-go API usage (the model IDs `fugu` and `fugu-ultra`), separate from
the subscription quota windows above. `console.sakana.ai/billing` renders this data server-side under its
"Pay as you go" tab, but that tab's markup is only present in the HTML response when the request URL includes
`?tab=payAsYouGo` — the default `/billing` response (used for the subscription quota fetch above) does not include
it. CodexBar issues a **second, best-effort** GET to `https://console.sakana.ai/billing?tab=payAsYouGo` with the same
cookie header immediately after the subscription fetch succeeds — skipped entirely (no request made) when
`context.includeOptionalUsage` is `false`, i.e. Settings → Advanced → "Show optional credits and extra usage" is
disabled.

- **Credit balance**: parsed from the `<h2>Credit balance</h2>` card's adjacent `tabular-nums` amount.
- **Recent usage total**: parsed from the `Usage` chart header's `Total: $…` text, covering whatever date range is
  currently selected on the console (defaults to the last 30 days). React renders this text with `<!-- -->`
  hydration-boundary comments splitting the label from the amount; the parser strips those before reading the value.
- **Date range label**: the raw text of the "Usage date range" picker button (e.g. `Jun 02, 2026 - Jul 01, 2026`),
  kept only as context — CodexBar does not currently interpret it as start/end dates.

This second fetch never throws and never blocks the primary result: if it fails (network error, non-200, wrong
origin, empty body, or the expected markup isn't found), the pay-as-you-go fields are simply absent from that
refresh and the subscription quota windows are returned exactly as before. An account with no pay-as-you-go credit
purchased still returns a `$0.00` balance (the card is always rendered), so absence here almost always means the
request itself failed rather than "no credit."

- Menu: a `Balance: $X.XX` row (and a `Recent usage: $X.XX` row when the usage total parses) appears alongside the
  quota windows.
- Not shown in the menu bar text: unlike some other credits-only providers, Sakana already has real 5-hour/weekly
  rate windows, and the "secondary metric" preference that would otherwise select an alternate menu bar display is
  the legitimate way to show the *weekly* window there. Reusing it for the PAYG balance would silently replace the
  weekly percentage for anyone who picks that preference, so the balance is menu-only for now.

## CLI usage

```
codexbar usage --provider sakana
codexbar usage --provider sakana-ai   # alias
```

Set the cookie via the environment variable or Settings UI:

- **Environment variable**: `SAKANA_COOKIE=<cookie-header-value> codexbar usage --provider sakana`
- **Settings UI**: Settings → Providers → Sakana AI → Cookie header

There is no `codexbar config set` command for `cookieHeader`; use one of the paths above.

## Errors

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `missingCookie` | No `Cookie:` header is configured and `SAKANA_COOKIE` is unset. |
| `loginRequired` | The request was unauthorized/forbidden, redirected, or ended on a different origin. |
| `apiError(Int)` | The billing page returned a non-`200` status not classified as a login failure. |
| `parseFailed(String)` | The billing response was empty or its quota data could not be parsed. |
